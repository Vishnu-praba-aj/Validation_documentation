If broker's perspective is needed that that is in transaction - what broker did to CITI
## Perspective
    The document is issued by a broker to XYZ. Always extract field values from the **broker's perspective**.

    - Interpret roles (like Buyer, Seller, Transaction) from the brokerâ€™s point of view.
    - If the broker sold to XYZ, then `"Transaction"` is `"Sell"`.
    - `"Company Name or Bank Name"` should always refer to the **counterparty**, i.e., the company the broker is transacting with (e.g., XYZ).
    - Never return the broker's own name unless explicitly asked (e.g., for a field like "Broker Name").
