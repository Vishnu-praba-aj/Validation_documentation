# Field Validation Documentation

## File: form.js
The provided JavaScript code doesn't define any classes or objects.  Instead, it defines a function `validateForm` that operates on a data object passed as an argument.  Therefore, we can't list fields within classes.  Instead, we'll list the fields of the *data object* that `validateForm` expects and their respective validations.

* **Data Object Fields and Validation:**

  * **`name`**:
    * **Validation:**  Must be provided (not null or undefined) and have a length of at least 3 characters.  The validation explicitly checks for both conditions.
  * **`email`**:
    * **Validation:** Must contain the "@" symbol.  This is a basic email validation check, but far from comprehensive.
  * **`age`**:
    * **Validation:** Must be a number and must be greater than or equal to 18. The validation explicitly checks the data type and the minimum value.

## File: test.py
There are no classes or objects defined in the provided `test.py` file.  The code defines a function `register_user`, which takes `name`, `age`, and `email` as parameters. These are not fields of an object; they are function arguments.  Therefore, there are no fields to list.

The function itself performs validation on its parameters:

* **`name` (str):**  Validation: Must not be empty.  A `ValueError` is raised if it is.
* **`age` (int):** Validation: Must be at least 18. A `ValueError` is raised if it's less than 18.
* **`email` (str):** Validation: Must contain the "@" symbol. A `ValueError` is raised if it doesn't.

These are input validations within the function's scope, not field validations within a class.

## File: User.java
## User Class Fields and Validation

* **`User.name` (String):**  No explicit validation is present in the code.  However, it's likely that a real-world application would implement validation to check for:
    * **Null or empty:**  The name shouldn't be null or an empty string.
    * **Length:** The name might have a maximum length constraint.
    * **Character restrictions:**  Certain characters might be disallowed.

* **`User.age` (int):**  Explicit validation is performed in the constructor.
    * **Non-negative:** The `age` must be greater than or equal to 0.  An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if `age` is negative.
